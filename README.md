## Description
 PWAs are great applications for saving information even when offline. Text editors can be important for saving notes or writing code, so I wanted to create one that could function both online and offline.

## Usage
 Clicking install installs the application, and after it functions as the save button. The program will also save whatever is in the editor to the indexed database when the window is no longer in focus. The program can be accessed at https://intense-wave-90787-53d84a.herokuapp.com/

## Installation
 Run npm i in the terminal in both the server folder and the client folder.
